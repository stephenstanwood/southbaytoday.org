// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// audienceAge — classify events as "kids" | "adult" | "all" from title+desc.
//
// Tag applied at ingest time (generate-events.mjs). Plan-day reads the tag
// at candidate-pool time to exclude kids-only events from adult plans and
// adults-only events from kids plans. "all" is the default and hits both.
//
// Bias is CONSERVATIVE — only strong, unambiguous signals trigger "kids" or
// "adult". Everything else stays "all". The goal is to kill obvious
// mismatches ("Kids Knitting" in an adult plan, "Wine Tasting" in a kids
// plan) without dropping mixed events that genuinely work for both.
//
// Note: brewpubs, bars, and breweries are NOT adult-only by default — many
// serve food and welcome families. Only the EVENT itself being 21+/drag/etc.
// flips the tag to "adult". Same for "kids" — a community event that says
// "kids welcome" is still "all", not "kids".
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Strong kids-only signals: explicit age ranges, preschool/toddler, story
// time, puppet shows, "kids [activity]" patterns. Note: "kids" alone is NOT
// enough — "Family Day: Kids Welcome" should stay "all".
//
// Age digits are bounded by three ranges, each pinning a different leakage class:
//   - KIDS_AGE (0-17): kid territory. Used for the bare "ages 5" and the lower
//     bound of "ages X-Y" — anything ≥18 is not a kid.
//   - KIDS_AGE_RANGE_UPPER (0-18): allows the upper bound of "ages 13-18" to
//     match (HS senior caps at 18). Tighter than 17 would untag legitimate teen
//     programs whose range stops at 18; wider would let "ages 5-25" leak in.
//   - KIDS_AGE_OPEN (0-12): the open-ended forms "ages X+" and "ages X and up"
//     have no upper bound, so "ages 13+" / "ages 13 and up" are ambiguous — an
//     open mic that says "all levels and ages 13+" welcomes adults. Capping at
//     12 confines the open form to true kid-program copy ("ages 5+ welcome").
//
// Before these bounds, "ages 50+" (senior events) and "ages 18-65" (adult
// forums) silently triggered kids; "ages 13+" on an open mic falsely tagged it
// kids; and "ages 12 to 25" (young-adult book clubs) matched on the lower bound
// alone because the upper escaped the range pattern.
