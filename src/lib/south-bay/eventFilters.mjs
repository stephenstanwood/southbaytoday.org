 * 1. `isFull` is NOT a reliable sold-out signal. When provider is "EXTERNAL"

 *    page advertises "August & September Appointments Still Available". So
 *    `full` requires actual seat accounting; without it an EXTERNAL event
 *    stays appointment-only/required and gets labelled rather than suppressed.
 *
 * 2. A non-null `cap` does NOT imply registration. Palo Alto's "Open Sewing
 *    Studio", "Photography Meetup" and "Meditation with Sara" all carry
 *    cap/maxSeats with provider null, no instructions, and numberRegistered
 *    null — room capacity noted on a drop-in, nothing to book. Gating on cap
 *    would have wrongly suppressed ~40 genuine walk-up events.
 *
 * `definition.registrationInfo.isFull` is deliberately ignored in favour of
 * the top-level `ev.isFull`: the definition is shared across every instance of
 * a recurring series, so its copy goes stale (Palo Alto's "STEAM Lab Saturday"
 * reports definition isFull:false on an instance whose own isFull is true).

 *   FULL / WAITLIST     out of seats
 *   CLOSED              RSVPs shut
 *
 * Shipped 2026-09-07 after that morning's issue opened by calling a Hacker
 * Dojo BBQ and PASCA's "Monday Pizza Social in the Garden" "both
 * no-registration walk-ups", and said so again in Tonight's Pick. The pizza
 * social is JOIN_APPROVAL with maxTickets 31 — its CTA reads "Request to
 * join", so a reader who took the newsletter at its word could be turned
 * away at an approval gate. Every Meetup event reached the planner with no
 * `registration` field at all, indistinguishable from a park concert.
 *
 * THREE TRAPS, all observed in that same 49-event sample:
 *
 * 1. `rsvpState` is the CURRENT MEMBER's state, so it can describe our OAuth
 *    identity rather than the reader's. A group we have already joined
 *    reports RSVP/YES/NO instead of a JOIN_* value, which says nothing about
 *    what a stranger faces. Those states therefore fall through to
 *    `group.joinMode`, which is member-independent. (All 49 sampled events
 *    returned JOIN_* — we belong to none of these groups — so this is a
 *    guard against the day someone signs the service account into one.)
 *
 * 2. `isPrivate` does NOT gate admission. It hides a group's content from
 *    non-members; the join mode is a separate setting. South Bay Adventure's
 *    "Willow Glens Goombah's Car Show" is isPrivate:true with joinMode OPEN
 *    and rsvpState JOIN_OPEN — a genuine open RSVP. Gating on isPrivate
 *    would have suppressed 6 of 49 events, several of them walk-ups.
 *
 * 3. `maxTickets` alone does NOT imply registration — the same discipline the
 *    BiblioCommons classifier documents as its trap 2. 16 of 49 events carry
 *    a positive maxTickets, most of them open-RSVP. A cap only matters once
 *    the seats are actually gone, and unlike BiblioCommons' advisory `cap`,
 *    Meetup enforces this one, so an exhausted cap IS real seat accounting.
 *
 * The converse of trap 1 also bites: `joinMode` alone is not enough either.
 * Desi Social & Network Group runs joinMode OPEN with rsvpState
 * JOIN_DUES_APPROVAL — dues plus approval on an "open" group. Both signals
 * are needed, with the CTA state first.

 * is appointment-only — "Registration is required to use this service...
 * Appointments are limited to one per household per week. Register below for
 * a 90-minute session" — but the LibCal ingest set no `registration` field at
 * all, so requiresAdvanceRegistration() read every LibCal event, across both
 * libraries, as a walk-up. That is the same defect the BiblioCommons
 * classifier above was written for on 2026-08-12, left unfixed on this path.
 *
 * TWO TRAPS, both observed in that 469-event sample:
 *
 * 1. `registration_enabled` is a reliable POSITIVE and a worthless NEGATIVE.
 *    It reports whether this listing row has a LibCal signup form bolted on,
 *    not whether a reader can turn up. All eight upcoming Community
 *    Preservation Lab occurrences report false while their own description
 *    says registration is required and links two separately-booked 90-minute
 *    slots — the booking lives in the body copy, not in LibCal's form. The
 *    same program's own occurrences also disagree with each other: Pages and
 *    Paws is true on its October date and false on November and December,
 *    because the flag tracks whether registration has OPENED yet. So a false
 *    never ends the inquiry; the text is always consulted.
 *
 * 2. Text must be allowed to override the flag DOWNWARD, which is the
 *    opposite of the BiblioCommons rule above. There, `provider` names an
 *    actual registrar and text may not downgrade it. Here, seven Mountain
 *    View events carry the form AND say "Registration is recommended. Seating
 *    is limited. Walk-ins are also welcome." — three Ukulele Jam sessions,
 *    Dogbotic Sound Petting Zoo, two estate-planning talks and a
 *    vegetable-gardening class. Letting the flag win would have gated four
 *    real walk-up programs. LibCal's own form widget prints a stock
 *    "Registration is required. There are 21 seats available." banner on
 *    those pages; the library's sentence is the one that describes the door.
 *
 * So DROP_IN_PATTERNS run first and beat every other signal, including the
 * flag. That also covers Los Gatos' "Drop-In Tech Help" — 17 occurrences
 * whose copy reads "No appointment is needed, we help patrons on a first come
 * first served basis", matching APPOINTMENT_PATTERNS on the very word that
 * says it is not one.

 *   EVENT_START  closes `ordinal` × `unit` before the instance starts
 *                (ordinal 0 = at start; SJPL teen meetings use hours).
 *   EVENT_END    same, anchored to the instance end.
 *   RELATIVE     `ordinal` × `unit` before the start, at the `time` clock —
 *                BiblioCommons resolves this against the SERIES' first
 *                session, which the instance record doesn't carry, so this
 *                computes against the INSTANCE start instead. That makes the
 *                result an UPPER BOUND: a mid-series instance's true deadline
 *                (first session − ordinal) is never later than this. "Past the
 *                upper bound" therefore proves closed; "before it" proves
 *                nothing, which is what the newsletter's live re-check is for.
 *                (A stray `date` rides along on RELATIVE rules — e.g. the
 *                ukulele's said 2025-07-16 — and is ignored.)
 *
 * BIBLIO_EVENTS ONLY. When registration runs off-platform (provider
 * "EXTERNAL"), the rule fields are vestigial config BiblioCommons itself
 * ignores: SJPL's recurring "(Virtual) Math Club" carries a STATIC end of
 * 2023-09-12 on 2027 instances while the live registration_windows endpoint
 * reports ACTIVE with no window at all (verified 2026-09-01). Deriving a
 * deadline from those would have closed three open programs in the first
 * 800 live events sampled. Same discipline as isFull/registrationClosed:
 * EXTERNAL per-field state is noise.
