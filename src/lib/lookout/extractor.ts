}

CRITERIA — only include events that meet BOTH:
1. **Open to the public** — anyone can show up. Skip private/internal/members-only events.
2. **Interesting** — would be worth telling a neighbor about. Skip routine procedural stuff.

INCLUDE these kinds of events:
- Festivals, fairs, markets, parades, block parties, public celebrations
- Free or ticketed cultural events: concerts, theater, art openings, exhibits, film screenings
- Family/kid events: egg hunts, story times, holiday celebrations, library kid programs
- Educational public events: lectures, classes that are open to anyone
- Community service: volunteer cleanups, food drives, donation events
- Sports events open to the public: races, tournaments, opening days
- Business openings (grand openings of restaurants, shops, venues)
- Town halls and listening sessions explicitly marked as community-facing
- Public art walks, gallery nights, food/wine events

EXCLUDE these kinds of events:
- Council meetings, commission meetings, committee meetings, board meetings, study sessions
- Public hearings, RFP/bid announcements, legal notices
- Deadlines, application windows, "save the date" without a confirmed date
- Welcome/confirmation/security emails (return {"events": []} for these entirely)
- School-internal events: PTA meetings, parent-teacher conferences, in-school assemblies, opportunity fairs only for enrolled students
- Members-only: chamber mixers, private galas, ticketed donor events
- Coffee chats / office hours / "meet the mayor" 1-on-1 slots
- Recognition / past events the newsletter is recapping
- Private parties, weddings, corporate events held at venues
- Recurring meetings without a specific named instance (e.g. "every first Monday")
- Vague announcements about ongoing programs without a specific event date

Other rules:
- Only return events with a CONCRETE date. Skip "ongoing", recurring weekly things unless the email announces a specific named instance, and vague "coming soon" items.
- Skip events past today's date.
- Deduplicate within one email.
- Do NOT invent fields. If a field is missing, use null (or empty string for description).
- Prefer the event's own page URL over the newsletter's main URL.
  - NEVER use a mailto: link as sourceUrl. If the only contact is an email address, set sourceUrl to null.
  - NEVER use Constant Contact / ccsend / click-tracking redirect URLs that don't point at a public event page. Prefer the venue or chamber's own URL.
- If the city is Morgan Hill or Gilroy, return cityName: null (we don't cover those).
- Return ONLY the JSON object, no markdown code fences, no commentary.

FLYER PARSING — chamber newsletters often include event flyers with details laid out in tables or side-by-side cells (date on one side, time + address on the other). When you see a flyer-style block for an event, pull the time and location from the adjacent cells, not just the headline. Ribbon cuttings, grand openings, and mixers usually have a specific street address AND a specific time (e.g. "3:00 PM / 45 W Main Street, Los Gatos, CA") — do not return null for location/startsAt time when the flyer shows them. If a time is given, include it in startsAt as "T15:00:00-07:00" (or the correct offset), not "T00:00:00".`;
