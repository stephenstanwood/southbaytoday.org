  // the South Bay. Was mislabeled "Santa Clara." Founder Elias Manousos's
  // profile and the launch coverage (SecurityWeek, SiliconANGLE) all place it
  // in SF. Far north of Redwood City; out of coverage.
  // Note: Fireworks AI ($1.5B Series D, July 2026) and Cognichip ($60M Series A,
  // April 2026) are both Redwood City / San Mateo County — north of the Santa
  // Clara County line every other entry here sits inside. Out of coverage
  // unless the footprint explicitly expands.
  // Note: ChipAgents' HQ was resolved 2026-08-03 — it IS in coverage, and both
  // its 2026 entries below stay. An older note here called the HQ "disputed"
  // (Santa Barbara / Goleta per Sacra and the Pacific Coast Business Times) and
  // said the company was deliberately excluded, which had already gone stale —
  // the Feb Series A1 entry was in the list. Primary sources now agree: the
  // July 29 2026 Series A2 release carries a "Santa Clara, Calif." dateline and
  // its boilerplate reads "headquartered in Santa Clara, California," and the
  // company's own careers page lists HQ at 6280 America Center Drive, Suite 200,
  // San Jose, with Goleta as a separate R&D office. The Pacific Coast Business
  // Times — the Santa Barbara paper whose coverage anchored the old exclusion —
  // now writes that ChipAgents "is headquartered in Santa Clara but was founded
  // and still houses major operations in Goleta." Keep BOTH the A1 ($50M, Feb)
  // and A2 ($60M, Jul) entries: those are separate raises of new money on the way
  // to $134M cumulative, not one round restated like the Upscale AI case noted
  // further down.
  // Note: Array Labs ($21M strategic round anchored by Mitsubishi Electric,
  // announced July 27–28 2026; mass-manufacturable space-based radar) is NOT
  // here despite AlleyWatch's weekly roundup filing it under "Palo Alto." The
  // city labels conflict and the most recent primary sources both point out of
  // coverage: the company's own July announcement page datelines Redwood City,
  // California, and its federal SAM.gov entity registration lists 889 Winslow
  // St, Redwood City. Only the older January Series A press release carries a
  // "PALO ALTO, Calif." dateline, and the company's own boilerplate says just
  // "Based in Silicon Valley." Redwood City is San Mateo County — the same line
  // that already excludes Fireworks AI and Cognichip above. Out of coverage
  // unless a primary source puts the HQ back inside Santa Clara County.
  // Note: Katalyze AI ($10.5M seed, July 6 2026; agentic OS for pharma) is NOT
  // here despite FinSMEs and TechStartups both labeling it "Mountain View." The
  // company's own announcement and About page place it in San Francisco (with a
  // second office in Toronto), and BetaKit describes it as an SF startup with
  // SF-based CEO Reza Farahani. Aggregator city labels are wrong here — out of
  // coverage. Do not add from the "Mountain View" tag alone.
  // Note: Naïve's city labels conflict — the techstartups.com roundup files it
  // under "Menlo Park" (San Mateo County, out of coverage). Primary sources win
  // and all agree on Palo Alto: the company's own funding press release carries
  // a "PALO ALTO, CA" dateline and calls itself "a Palo Alto-based AI lab," and
  // SiliconANGLE's and Pulse 2's independent write-ups both say Palo Alto. Same
  // aggregator-label problem as the Katalyze AI and Array Labs notes above, but
  // resolving the opposite way — in coverage.
  // Note: Volta is tri-headquartered and its own Business Wire release datelines
  // "LONDON, PALO ALTO, Calif. and NEW YORK" — Palo Alto is one of three co-equal
  // HQs, not the single HQ the rest of this list is judged on. Kept in coverage
  // because a primary source puts an HQ inside Santa Clara County and the
  // company's own site lists Palo Alto first among its offices; that is the
  // opposite of the Fireworks AI / Cognichip / Array Labs cases, where primary
  // sources put the only HQ in San Mateo County. Do not re-litigate from the
  // London or New York datelines alone.
  // Note: Whatnot ($545M Series G at a $20B valuation, announced Aug 7 2026 —
  // by dollars the largest "South Bay" round of the week) is NOT here, despite
  // the techstartups.com Aug 10 roundup filing it under "Palo Alto." No primary
  // or independent source supports that city: Wikipedia's infobox reads "Los
  // Angeles, California," the article says the company "was incorporated in
  // Delaware but is based in Marina Del Rey, California," and the corporate
  // directories agree on 578 Washington Blvd, Marina del Rey. That is Los
  // Angeles County — not adjacent to coverage the way the San Mateo County
  // exclusions above are. Same aggregator-mislabel problem as Katalyze AI and

  // FRANCISCO, SiliconANGLE's write-up says "headquartered in San Francisco,"
  // and VC News Daily independently lists San Francisco. The release carries no
  // "About Owner" boilerplate to appeal to. Same aggregator-mislabel class as

  // Note: the Aug 27 - Sep 2 2026 sweep of the daily small-round feeds (the
  // seed / sub-$25M tier the weekly roundups skip) surfaced no Santa Clara
  // County companies at all — the week's Bay Area rounds were San Francisco
  // (AusperBio, CivilGrid, Hike Medical, SciFin, Tripo AI) and Redwood City
  // (N-Power Medicine). Recorded so the next cycle doesn't re-walk the same
  // five days expecting a gap in the list.
  // Note: the Aug 2026 small-round sweep — the seed / sub-$25M tier the big
  // weekly roundups skip, which is where this list's real differentiation sits —
  // surfaced three stealth exits and none of them are in coverage. Recorded so
  // the next cycle doesn't re-verify the same three:
  //   • Actualyze AI ($7M seed, Aug 3 2026; enterprise AI governance layer).
  //     Its own PR Newswire release datelines Pasadena and the boilerplate says
  //     Pasadena. Los Angeles County. The Morado Ventures / AME Cloud (Jerry
  //     Yang) cap table reads South Bay, but investors are not an HQ.
  //   • June AI ($20M pre-seed led by Marc Benioff's TIME Ventures, Aug 3 2026).
  //     New York City — the GlobeNewswire release and every write-up agree.
  //   • Arrakis ($38M out of stealth, Jul 22 2026; industrial AI agents).
  //     London and Paris, expanding to New York and the Middle East.
  // Note on River AI's round label: the Business Wire release says only "$1.1
  // billion in funding" and names no series, so this is filed as a Venture
  // Round rather than inventing a letter. Crunchbase's weekly roundup guessed
  // "Seed/Series A"; the primary source doesn't say, so neither do we.
  // Note on Groq's city: the aggregators file the August round under "Mountain
  // View" and Wikipedia's infobox still says the same, but that address (400
  // Castro St) is stale. Groq LLC's SEC Form D filed 2026-07-24 gives 2700
  // Zanker Road, Suite 150, San Jose 95134 as both business and mailing
  // address, and EDGAR's entity record matches. San Jose is in coverage either
  // way, so this is a precision fix rather than an include/exclude call — the
  // SCC_SPOTLIGHT entry above was corrected to match. Groq's own release
  // datelines "San Francisco, CA"; that is announcement issuance, not an HQ
  // claim, and its boilerplate names no city.
  // Note on the round label: "Series A" is the company's own headline for a
  // ten-year-old company that had already raised well over $1B, which reads
  // oddly, but the primary source says Series A and that is what is recorded.
  // TechCrunch and Bloomberg describe it only as a funding round.
  // Etched's Aug 18 raise is NEW money four weeks after the July 23 Series C —
  // two distinct rounds at two distinct valuations ($10.3B then $21B), so both
  // entries stay (same call as the ChipAgents A1/A2 pair above, not the Upscale
  // AI restatement case). Round is recorded as "Venture Round": Etched's own
  // release assigned no letter, and only secondary coverage calls it a Series D.
  // ── Week of Aug 17–24 2026 ──────────────────────────────────────────────
  // Note: Rillet ($100M Series C at a $1B valuation led by ICONIQ, announced
  // Aug 19 2026) is NOT here despite AlleyWatch's weekly roundup filing it
  // under "Palo Alto, CA." Every other source puts the HQ in New York, with
  // offices in San Francisco and Barcelona — techstartups' own roundup the
  // same week lists it as San Francisco, and TechCrunch's write-up carries no
  // South Bay claim. Same aggregator-label problem as the Katalyze AI and
  // Array Labs notes above. Out of coverage; do not add from the "Palo Alto"
  // tag alone.
  // Note: Rundoo ($30M Series B, Aug 19) and Twin1 AI ($20M seed, Aug 20) both
  // appear in roundups near the South Bay entries but are Redwood City and San
  // Mateo respectively — San Mateo County, the same line that excludes
  // Fireworks AI and Cognichip above.
  // Note on Palona's city: the funding coverage (SiliconANGLE, FinSMEs) and the
  // 2025 seed coverage all say "Palo Alto," but the company's own Aug 17 2026
  // release datelines "LOS ALTOS, Calif." and its boilerplate names no city.
  // Both are Santa Clara County, so this is a precision fix rather than an
  // include/exclude call — same handling as the Groq city note above.
  // Note on Also: the Aug 19 Series D is NEW money, not a restatement of the
  // March 31 Series C — different letter, different amount, and TechCrunch's
  // headline reads "raises another $150 million" against a $455M cumulative
  // total. Both entries stay (the ChipAgents A1/A2 and Etched calls above).
  // Note on the Aug 25–30 2026 sweep: SiFly, Agentrys, and Corvus Robotics are
  // the in-coverage rounds added below. Recorded so the next cycle doesn’t
  // re-verify the same three near-misses:
  //   • Instinct ($250M Series B at $2.5B, announced Aug 26 2026; consumer AI
  //     assistant) is San Francisco. Founder Noah Shinn’s operating entity is
  //     Spear Street Technology, an SF company, and SiliconANGLE, Qz, and the
  //     TechCrunch write-up all say SF. No source places it in coverage.
  //   • Lambda’s $926M senior secured term loan B (closed Aug 28 2026) is a
  //     San Jose company and in coverage geographically, but it is debt, not an
  //     equity round — every one of the ~100 entries here is venture equity or a
  //     convertible, and a $926M GPU-purchase facility would swamp the derived
  //     "Raised in …" total that TechnologyView computes off this list. Left out
  //     on kind, not on geography. (FinSMEs headlined it "$962M"; the company’s
  //     own release and Bloomberg both say $926M. The aggregator has a typo.)
  //   • PATH (undisclosed round, Aug 26 2026) is Fremont — Alameda County, the
  //     same out-of-coverage call as the San Mateo County exclusions above.
  // Note on the Sep 1-6 2026 sweep: Visko and Guickly are the in-coverage
  // rounds added below. The near-miss recorded so the next cycle doesn't
  // re-verify it:
  //   • Owner ($240M Series D at $2.3B, announced Aug 28 2026; AI-native
  //     software for independent restaurants) is left out on an unresolved HQ.
  //     AlleyWatch's weekly roundup, Wikipedia, and the usual aggregators
  //     (CBInsights, PitchBook, ZoomInfo) all say Palo Alto, at 530 Lytton Ave.
  //     But the only primary source is the company's own PR Newswire release,
  //     and it datelines "SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 28, 2026" with no HQ line in the
  //     boilerplate; owner.com/careers advertises remote-friendly roles and
  //     names no office city. Same rule that excluded Katalyze AI and Array
  //     Labs — an aggregator city label alone is not enough. Add it if a
  //     primary source (a release dateline, an SEC filing, a contact page)
  //     puts the HQ in Palo Alto.
  //   • Gimlet Labs ($300M Series B at $3B, Sep 4 2026) is San Francisco per
  //     Bloomberg and the company's own release. Out of coverage.
  //   • The Sep 3 and Sep 4 daily funding roundups carried no Santa Clara
  //     County rounds at all.
  // Note on the Sep 3–7 2026 sweep: TabaPay is the one in-coverage round,
  // and its city label needed resolving before it could be added. FinSMEs,
  // PitchBook, and ZoomInfo all file TabaPay under Mountain View (ZoomInfo
  // gives 605 Ellis St), but both primary sources say Palo Alto: the funding
  // release issued through FTV Capital datelines "PALO ALTO, Calif. —
  // September 2, 2026," and the company's California DFPI money-transmitter
  // license (ID 2769, TabaPay Payment Services, LLC) lists 450 Cambridge Ave,
  // Palo Alto. Same aggregator-label problem as Katalyze AI and Naïve, and it
  // resolves in coverage either way — Mountain View and Palo Alto are both
  // Santa Clara County — so the only thing at stake was which city the card
  // names. Primary sources win: Palo Alto.
  // Near-misses recorded so the next cycle doesn't re-verify them:
  //   * WindBorne Systems ($37M Series B, Aug 5 2026; long-duration sensing
  //     balloons feeding the WeatherMesh forecast models) is NOT here despite
  //     FinSMEs calling it "Palo Alto, CA-based." The company's own
  //     announcement datelines "Redwood City, CA" and says only that WindBorne
  //     was founded in Palo Alto — past tense, a founding story, not an HQ.
  //     Redwood City is San Mateo County, the same line that already excludes
  //     Fireworks AI, Cognichip, and Array Labs. Out of coverage unless a
  //     primary source moves the HQ back across the county line.
  //   * Thinking Machines Lab (reported ~$1B round in talks at a $40B
  //     valuation, Sep 3 2026) is San Francisco, and a round in talks is not a
  //     closed round. Out on both counts.
  // Note on the Sep 7-8 2026 sweep: no in-coverage round surfaced. The daily
  // funding roundups for both days carried zero Santa Clara County companies
  // (Sep 7: Pixxel, Jet Zero, Navana.ai, Cato, Jaipur Robotics; Sep 8: Mistral
  // AI, Stoke Space, ARC Ride, Hope Care, Fundly.ai, Veridue, Outline, Gaia,
  // sci2sci, Iztri — all international or out of state). One near-miss, recorded
  // so the next cycle doesn't re-verify it:
  //   * Clipto ($15M at a $250M post-money valuation, announced Aug 31 2026;
  //     on-device search across a user's own video, audio, and image library) is
  //     NOT here despite AlleyWatch's 9/8 weekly roundup filing it under "Palo
  //     Alto" and Crunchbase giving 425 Page Mill Rd. The primary source for
  //     THIS round is the company's own WebWire release, and it datelines "San
  //     Francisco - Monday, August 31, 2026"; TechCrunch's independent write-up
  //     the same day calls Clipto "San Francisco-headquartered." An older
  //     Clipto release does dateline Palo Alto (GlobeNewswire, Jan 5 2026), but
  //     it announces no amount, and the newer primary source wins on a moved HQ
  //     — the same call the Array Labs note above makes in the same direction.
  //     Out of coverage. Two further reasons not to add it on a later "Palo
  //     Alto" tag alone: the Aug 31 date sits inside the Aug 27 - Sep 2 window
  //     already swept above, and the $250M valuation appears in both the January
  //     and the August announcements, so a second entry would risk restating one
  //     raise the way the Upscale AI entry did.
  // Note on the Sep 9 2026 sweep: no in-coverage round surfaced. The day's
  // funding roundup carried zero Santa Clara County companies (Cognition AI and
  // VideoGen are San Francisco; Algomatic Dynamics, QNu Labs, CloudNC, Limetax,
  // Carrum Mobility, ZeroRisk, Tanda, and Allogenetics are all international).
  // Nothing new against the Clipto near-miss recorded just above either.
  // Note on the Sep 9-10 2026 sweep: Cylake's $245M convertible note is the one
  // in-coverage round, and it is a late catch rather than a new day's news. The
  // company's own GlobeNewswire release datelines "SUNNYVALE, Calif., Sept. 08,
  // 2026" — inside the Sep 7-8 window swept above — but it did not reach the
  // daily roundups until Sep 9, which is why the earlier pass recorded that
  // window as empty. Sweeping a date range by announcement date alone misses
  // releases that surface a day late; check the following day's roundup against
  // the prior window before calling it closed. Near-misses recorded so the next
  // cycle doesn't re-verify them:
  //   * Lightfield ($47M Series A led by a16z, Sep 9 2026; AI-native CRM) is San
  //     Francisco — its own PR Newswire release, SiliconANGLE, and Unite.AI all
  //     agree. The techstartups roundup lists no city at all for it.
  //   * The rest of the Sep 9 roundup is out of coverage: Harvey and Euno are
  //     San Francisco, Solstice Oncology is Boston, Clay/Savvy Wealth/WINT are
  //     New York, Perry Weather is Dallas, CloudNC is London.
  //   * The Sep 10 roundup carried no US Bay Area rounds at all (Metacognition
  //     AI is Adelaide, DYU and SinapisAI and Huani and ELEHEAR are China,
  //     HeyDiga is Madrid, KVector is Birmingham, Bynario is Milan, Medteria is
  //     Fukuoka, and Wyre AI is the Washington DC area).

Lightspeed Venture Partners, Picture Capital, and Redpoint Ventures put in the money.

The $155M from FTV Capital, a mix of primary capital and a secondary sale, funds an unusual next step: rather than keep leasing access, TabaPay intends to buy Transact Bank, an OCC-chartered, FDIC-insured bank in Denver, rename it TabaBank, and put both companies under a new holding company. TabaBank would complement its partner-bank network and support major rails including RTP, FedNow, ACH, wire transfers, and card sponsorship. Co-founder and CEO Rodney Robinson says the point is to bring payments and banking under one roof; FTV partner Robert Anderson joined TabaPay's board. The acquisition is subject to customary regulatory approval and is expected to close in the fourth quarter. It is also the company's second run at buying its way into new infrastructure — TabaPay walked away from a $9.7M deal for Synapse's assets in 2024 when closing conditions went unmet.",

The hard part it claims to have solved is drift. Founder and CEO Qing (Will) Yin says the longer a generated world runs, the more it falls apart; Orbis answers that by modeling the world as continuous neural stochastic differential equations, with perception, memory, and physics sharing one latent space, instead of predicting one discrete frame after another. Yin holds a Stanford PhD in computational mathematics and mechanics and spent three years as an Apple researcher; the 16-person team comes out of Apple, Google DeepMind, Meta, Amazon, and Tesla, advised by Berkeley's Michael I.

The pitch leans on a McKinsey finding the company cites, that only 39% of organizations can connect AI spending to a measurable business outcome. For security-conscious buyers, the differentiator is that prompts and source code stay on premises instead of being shipped to a vendor for analysis. Founder Prashant Jalan spent more than eight years as an applied AI lead at Google, where he helped build the Maps speed-limit feature and wrote a profiler for squeezing performance out of TPUs — the same instinct, turned on a company's AI bill instead of a chip.

SiFly’s Q12 holds a Guinness World Record for the longest flight by an electric multirotor in its weight class — 3 hours, 11 minutes, 54 seconds on a single charge — and the aircraft is rated for 180 minutes aloft, 120 miles of range, and a 10-pound payload at up to 60 mph. Shield Capital led the $20M Series A with Qudit, BBK Capital, and Alumni Ventures joining; the money scales Q12 manufacturing and pushes DronePort, the company’s multi-drone ground infrastructure, toward field validation. The local piece worth watching: SiFly is negotiating a lease on a 15,000-square-foot Sunnyvale plant to build roughly 1,000 aircraft in 2027, with the first revenue-generating deliveries targeted for the first quarter. Hinman is unusually candid about the limits of building American — the Q12’s motors come from China because assembling them domestically would cost about three times as much, and NDAA compliance turns on cameras and radios rather than motors.",

Maverick Silicon, already Celera's largest investor, funded the entire $30M Series B on its own. The money accelerates the AI design-automation roadmap and customer projects, and expands the SiliconGate product-development and design-automation team in Portugal that Celera acquired, alongside new analog and AI design hires in California under CEO Patrick Brockett.",

It beat AMD's best chip by 20–40% in benchmarks and used less power doing it. PC makers raced to design new systems around it; it became one of the best-reviewed chips Intel ever made.

That decision cascaded through history: the Intel 286, 386, 486, Pentium, Core i9, and every AMD Ryzen and EPYC chip today all trace their lineage back to Santa Clara, 1978. Even Apple's transition from PowerPC to Intel (2006) and now to Apple Silicon (2020) is part of the x86 story — ARM ate x86's lunch only because x86 spent 40 years eating everyone else's.
