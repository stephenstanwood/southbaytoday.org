${bodyNote}

Your job: identify items that a South Bay resident would genuinely find interesting, surprising, or worth knowing about.

SKIP: routine approvals, consent calendar, minutes approval, procedural items, public comment with no outcome, generic budget discussions, YouTube/Zoom instructions.

SKIP HARDER: items where the agenda only shows a title (e.g. "Terminal Elevator Replacement Project") without enough substance to summarize. If you'd need to speculate or hedge ("though specifics weren't provided", "details unclear", "this could affect..."), the right move is to leave the item out, not to write a vague summary. A resident reading hedge text feels like they're reading filler.

NEVER FABRICATE: do not invent case names, party names, dollar amounts, vote counts, addresses, agency or regulator names, or any specific fact not present in the agenda data. Closed session line items often list only a citation like "Conf. with Legal Counsel — existing litigation" with no party names — if a name isn't in the source, do not make one up. Skip the item. When the source references compliance with regulations but doesn't name the specific agency, say "regional air quality regulations" or "state requirements" rather than inventing an agency name (e.g. there is no "South Bay Air District" — Bay Area air quality is regulated by BAAQMD).

NEVER NAME STAFF CONTACTS: Legistar agendas include bureaucratic metadata like "Staff Contact: Jane Doe" or "Project Manager: John Smith" or "Sponsoring Department: …". These identify the city employee handling the paperwork, NOT the subject of the action. Never write "This follows the staff contact listing X", "named X as the new …", or treat a staff-contact name as the appointee/principal of the item. Omit these names entirely.

MATCH THE SOURCE'S FRAMING — DO NOT NARROW: if a council resolution restricts "federal civil enforcement," do not narrow it to "immigration enforcement," "tax enforcement," or any specific subtype unless the agenda explicitly uses that word. Do not invent illustrative examples ("for immigration, tax, or other..."). Stick to the source's wording on sensitive framing.

DO NOT ASSERT THE BODY UNLESS THE AGENDA SUPPORTS IT: the "Body" label above is how the upstream feed classified the record, and it is sometimes wrong — advisory bodies (Architectural Review Board, Historic Resources Board, Teen/Youth Commission) get ingested under "City Council". If the agenda title reads as a recommendation TO the council ("Recommendation on …") or otherwise indicates a board or commission, do not write "Council approved/will weigh". Either name the body the agenda itself names, or write it body-neutrally ("Palo Alto is weighing …", "city staff recommended …"). Never upgrade an advisory recommendation into a council action.

NEVER REPORT THE BROWN ACT ATTENDANCE NOTICE: agendas for scoping meetings, study sessions, and joint hearings carry a boilerplate legal notice that members of other bodies "may be in attendance" — it exists to avoid an unnoticed serial meeting, and it says nothing about who actually showed up. Never write "with City Council / Planning Commission / Commission members possibly (or may be) in attendance". It is a disclaimer, not an event detail. Omit it.

DO NOT ASSERT APPROVAL FOR FUTURE OR SAME-DAY MEETINGS: if a meeting's date matches today's date and the agenda is forward-looking (e.g. "proposed", "to consider", "study session"), do not write that it was approved or adopted. Use forward-looking language ("to hear", "to consider", "scheduled to review") or skip the item.

KEEP: notable development projects (housing, commercial, controversial permits), policy changes affecting residents, contested votes, new programs/ordinances, zoning/land use decisions, physical changes to the city.

Meeting data:
${content}

NO FILLER ADJECTIVES: do not call a project "significant", "substantial", "major", "large-scale", "notable", or "important" without saying *why* the resident should care. Do not write "This represents …", "This reflects ongoing …", "This underscores …" — sentences that gesture at significance instead of stating it. If you can't name the concrete reason (jobs, units, location, price tag, who's affected), drop the second sentence. One useful sentence beats two with one of them puffed up.

Return a JSON array (may be empty if nothing is interesting). Each item:
{
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "headline": "short plain-English headline (max 12 words, no jargon). NEVER start a number with $; fiscal years like 2026-27 must be written as 'FY 2026-27', not '$2026-27'.",
  "summary": "1-2 sentences. What happened, why it matters. Written for a resident. NEVER use relative time words (tonight, today, this week) — use date or day name. NEVER admit you don't know what happened ('though specifics weren't provided', 'details weren't clear', 'without more details') — if you would have to, return [] instead. NEVER pad with filler significance language (see NO FILLER ADJECTIVES above)."

Pick the 1-2 most interesting ones that a resident would care about — new businesses, new housing, large construction projects, or anything unusual. Skip routine renovations and ADUs unless they fit a broader pattern worth pointing out.

Permits:
${permitText}${countsText}

IMPORTANT — a permit being issued means construction is *cleared to begin*, NOT that it has started. Do NOT write "breaks ground", "groundbreaking", "construction begins", "construction starts", or "launches" — those imply a milestone the data does not support. Use language like "permitted", "receives building permit", "cleared to build", "permit issued for". Do NOT label projects as "affordable", "workforce", or "luxury" unless that wording appears in the permit description.

USE TYPE OVER INFERENCE: when a permit line carries "[use type: …]", say what the building is for using that use type. Never infer the use from the unit count — "0 units" is what the field says for every non-residential permit, so do not write "no unit count is listed" or reason that a missing unit count "suggests" anything. If there is no use type, describe only what the description states.

NOT NAMES: San José permit descriptions carry a trade-scope code in parentheses — "(Bemp 100%)", "(Bepm100%)", "(Bep 100%)", "(B 100%)", "(B)", and "Srp" prefixes. These are Building/Electrical/Plumbing/Mechanical scope markers, NOT developers, businesses, or project names. Never name them as a party ("developer Bemp"). Ignore them entirely. Only name a developer, owner, or tenant when it appears in the description as an actual name.

COUNTS: the list above is the notable permits only, not every permit issued. If a VERIFIED COUNTS block appears, those totals are authoritative — state them exactly or omit the number; never substitute your own tally. Otherwise prefer wording that does not hinge on a total ("prefab ADUs permitted at…"). Never infer a gap, a missing unit, or a range from the unit/suite numbers in addresses — "#9" through "#15" is a naming scheme, not a sequence, so do not write "minus one", "all but one", "#9 through #15", or any similar range/exception phrasing.

NO FILLER ADJECTIVES: do not call a project "significant", "substantial", "major", "large-scale", "notable", or "important" without saying *why* the resident should care. Do not write "This represents …", "This reflects ongoing …", "This underscores …" — sentences that gesture at significance instead of stating it. If you can't name the concrete reason (square footage, units, tenant, dollar tag in context, neighborhood impact), drop the second sentence. One useful sentence beats two with one of them puffed up.

Return a JSON array. Each item:
{
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "headline": "short plain-English headline (max 12 words). Use permit-accurate verbs only.",
