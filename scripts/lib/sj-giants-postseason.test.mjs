// The adapter asked StatsAPI for `gameType=R` only, so the San Jose Giants
// postseason never reached the calendar. On 2026-09-01 that cost the site the
// two best baseball dates of the year: the Giants had clinched the California
// League North first half (standings API, firstHalf, 37–29, `clinched: true`)
// and were awarded home Division Series games at Excite Ballpark on Sep 10 and
// Sep 11, while the only regular-season games left were six road games in
// Fresno. The source reported "empty" for the whole month and a resident saw
// nothing.
//
// Two things make postseason rows different from regular-season rows, and both
// are represented below exactly as the live API returned them:
//
//   1. The undecided side is the placeholder franchise "To Be Determined"
//      (team id 41), which matches no California League market — so the
//      Copa-promo guard that keeps "Ontario Tower Buzzers" out would also
//      throw away a real home playoff date.
//   2. A slot the league hasn't timed yet carries a filler timestamp flagged
//      by `status.startTimeTBD` — the Sep 8 road game reads 10:33 UTC, i.e.
//      3:33 a.m. PT. Rendering that is a fabricated clock time.
