// Offline invariants on the projected-market config in generate-events.mjs.
//
// These markets are the one event source the pipeline projects forward instead
// of scraping per-occurrence, so a config typo doesn't fail loudly — it just
// silently publishes the wrong thing, or nothing. Both happened:
//
//   * Mountain View and Santana Row went dark for weeks because their evidence
//     patterns had drifted off the organizer pages' wording. sourceHealth still
//     showed the farmers-market source as "ok" the whole time, because the
//     other five markets were fine.
//   * Mountain View publishes six Sundays where the market moves to the Hope
//     St. lots. A relocation keyed to a date that isn't the market's weekday
//     would never fire and nobody would know.
//
// Nothing here touches the network: verifyMarketScheduleSource still has to
// confirm each page at run time, and these checks only guarantee the config it
// is handed is internally coherent.
