// Prebuild gate over the COMMITTED tech logo manifest. Offline — no network,
// no fetching. Fails the build when:
//   1. a manifest entry points at a file that isn't in /public/logos (broken
//      image on /tech),
//   2. two unrelated ids resolve to byte-identical images (a resolver strategy
//      fell through to somebody's site chrome, and one wrong mark gets stamped
//      on a pile of real companies), or
//   3. a company that isn't allowed to source from Wikipedia has a committed
//      logo recorded as coming from Wikipedia. Checks 1 and 2 both pass a
//      wrong-but-unique mark: /tech carried an Indonesian railway's logo on a
//      Palo Alto security startup's card for five months, and it took a manual
//      audit to find. Provenance is what makes that catchable at build time.
//
// The same audits run at the end of fetch-tech-logos.mjs, but nobody runs the
// fetcher on a schedule — this is the check that actually ships.
//
// Usage: node scripts/check-tech-logos.mjs
